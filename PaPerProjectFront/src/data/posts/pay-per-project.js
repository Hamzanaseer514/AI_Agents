        question: "Is 'pay per project' cheaper than hourly?",
        answer: "Not necessarily cheaper, but it offers better value and cost predictability. With a fixed price, you know the total cost upfront, preventing budget overruns. It incentivizes efficiency, so you pay for results, not just hours worked."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I need to change the scope of the project?",
        answer: "Scope changes are handled transparently. If a new feature or requirement is requested, it's scoped as a mini-project with its own fixed price. This keeps the original budget intact and ensures you only pay for the additional work you approve."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you find good pay per project jobs or freelancers?",
        answer: "Look for platforms that specialize in a fixed-price model and vet their talent. Vetted platforms attract experienced professionals who are confident in their ability to estimate and deliver projects efficiently, which is exactly who you want to hire."
