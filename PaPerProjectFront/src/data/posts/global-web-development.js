        question: "How do I hire a freelance web developer in the US?",
        answer: "Hiring a web developer in the US gives you access to top-tier talent, especially for cutting-edge technologies. The best way is to use a managed platform that vets developers for you. This saves you from competing with major tech firms for talent and ensures you get a professional who is both skilled and reliable."

      {
        question: "Is outsourcing web design different from outsourcing development?",
        answer: "While related, they require different skill sets. Web design focuses on UI/UX, aesthetics, and user journey mapping. Development is the technical implementation. When outsourcing, it's crucial to ensure your chosen partner has distinct, proven expertise in both areas or can provide a team where specialists handle each part."
