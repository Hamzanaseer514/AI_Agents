        question: "What is an MVP and why is it important for startups?",
        answer: "An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is the version of a new product that allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. It's crucial for startups to test their core idea, gather early user feedback, and secure funding without over-investing in features that might not be needed."
      },
      {
        question: "How quickly can an MVP be built?",
        answer: "The timeline for an MVP varies based on complexity, but the goal is to 'build MVP fast.' With a clear scope and an efficient team, an MVP can often be developed and launched within a few weeks to a few months. Outsourcing can significantly accelerate this process by providing immediate access to skilled developers."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I hire an MVP developer or outsource the entire product?",
        answer: "If you have strong in-house project management and design capabilities, hiring a freelance MVP developer might work. However, for comprehensive 'startup tech execution' and to 'outsourcing startup product' development efficiently, a managed service that provides a full team (including project managers, designers, and developers) is often more effective, ensuring a cohesive and faster launch."
