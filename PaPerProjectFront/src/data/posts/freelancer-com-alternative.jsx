          question: "What makes a 'managed outsourcing platform' a better alternative to Upwork or Freelancer.com?",
          answer: "A managed platform solves the biggest problems of open marketplaces: risk, quality control, and time waste. Instead of you sifting through hundreds of low-quality bids, we provide a perfectly matched, pre-vetted developer or team. We then add a layer of expert project management, quality guarantees, and IP protection, making us a true project partner, not just a talent directory."
      },
      {
          question: "How does the 'Fiverr vs. PayPerProject' model differ for serious projects?",
          answer: "Fiverr is a 'gig economy' marketplace, ideal for small, quick, transactional tasks. PayPerProject is designed for complex, end-to-end projects. With us, you're not just buying a small gig; you're commissioning a fully managed project with a dedicated team, clear milestones, and a success guarantee, all built on a transparent 'pay per project freelance model'."
      },
      {
          question: "Can I truly 'hire vetted developers with no commission'?",
          answer: "Yes, absolutely. Our business model is fundamentally different. We quote a single, fixed project price that transparently covers the cost of the elite talent and our comprehensive project management. There are no recurring commissions, processing fees, or other hidden charges that platforms like Upwork and Freelancer.com levy."
      },
      {
          question: "Why is your platform a top 'Upwork competitor in the UK'?",
          answer: "UK-based businesses prioritize quality, reliability, and clear communication above all else. Our managed model is built on these principles. By providing vetted, UK-based or nearshore talent, dedicated project management, and a secure, pay-per-project framework, we solve the main pain points UK clients face on open marketplaces."
      },
      {
        question: "What does 'vetted talent' actually mean in practice?",
        answer: "Vetted talent means every freelancer has passed a multi-stage screening process. This includes a portfolio review, rigorous technical skills tests, live coding challenges, and a behavioral interview to assess communication, reliability, and professionalism. Only the top 3-5% of applicants are accepted, saving you from the guesswork."
      },
      {
        question: "How does a 'managed outsourcing platform' handle project problems or delays?",
        answer: "If an issue arises, your dedicated project manager is your first point of contact and is responsible for resolving it. They will diagnose the problem, create a remediation plan, and manage the team to get back on track. This accountability is a core benefit of the managed model."
      },
      {
        question: "Is the 'pay per project freelance model' flexible enough for agile development?",
        answer: "Yes. While it's a fixed price for the total project, it can be structured to support agile workflows. The project is often broken down into a series of fixed-price 'sprints.' You pay for each sprint upon its successful completion and approval, giving you the flexibility of agile with the budget predictability of a fixed-price contract."
      },
      {
        question: "How are project scope changes handled to avoid surprise costs?",
        answer: "Scope changes are handled with full transparency. Your project manager will work with you to define the new requirements and then provide a separate, fixed-price quote for that additional work. This 'change order' must be approved by you before any work begins, ensuring the original budget and timeline remain clear and protected."
