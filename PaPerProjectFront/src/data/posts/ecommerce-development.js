        question: "What's the best platform for a new e-commerce site?",
        answer: "The 'best' platform depends on your specific needs. Shopify is great for ease of use and quick setup, while Magento offers more customization for larger, complex stores. A 'Shopify freelance expert' can help you get started quickly, or you might consider 'Magento development outsourcing' for more advanced requirements."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I find a reliable e-commerce developer?",
        answer: "Look for developers with a strong portfolio in e-commerce, good client testimonials, and expertise in your chosen platform. If you're in the UK, you might 'hire ecommerce developer Manchester' or use a managed outsourcing service to connect with vetted talent globally, ensuring quality and security."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it better to build a custom e-commerce site or use a platform?",
        answer: "For most businesses, using a platform like Shopify or Magento is more cost-effective and faster to launch. Custom development is usually reserved for highly unique business models that require features not available off-the-shelf. If you decide to 'build ecommerce site freelance,' ensure your developer has experience with custom solutions."
