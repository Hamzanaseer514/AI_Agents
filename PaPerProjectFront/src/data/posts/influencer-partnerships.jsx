      question: 'Is this just another affiliate program?',
      answer: 'No. While it has an affiliate component, it\'s a much deeper partnership. We offer co-branded content, custom landing pages, and for top partners, a share in the success of the projects you bring in. It\'s about building something together.'

    {
      question: 'How much can I realistically earn?',

    {
      question: 'Do I need to be technical to promote this?',
      answer: 'Not at all. Your role is to introduce the problem and the solution to your audience. Our team handles all the technical sales, scoping, and project execution. We provide you with all the marketing materials you need to succeed.'
