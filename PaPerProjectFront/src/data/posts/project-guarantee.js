        question: "What is a freelance project guarantee?",
        answer: "It is a contractual promise that the project will be delivered according to the agreed-upon scope and quality standards. If the final work doesn't meet the requirements, the managed service is obligated to fix it, often backed by project insurance to protect your investment."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you ensure IP protection with freelance developers?",
        answer: "IP protection is secured through legally binding contracts. This includes signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before discussing details and a contract that explicitly transfers 100% of the intellectual property rights to you upon final payment."
      },
      {
        question: "Is freelance project insurance really necessary?",
        answer: "For any significant project, yes. It acts as a financial safety net. If, in a worst-case scenario, the project fails to deliver, insurance can help recover your costs. It's a key part of what makes a managed outsourcing service truly risk-free."
