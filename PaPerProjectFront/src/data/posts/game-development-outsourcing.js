          question: "Why should I hire a game developer company per project instead of a freelancer?",
          answer: "For any game of moderate complexity, hiring a company is superior. A company provides a cohesive team of specialists—artists, designers, programmers, QA testers, and a project manager—who work in sync. This eliminates the massive overhead of you trying to coordinate multiple individual freelancers, ensures consistent quality, and provides a single point of accountability for the entire project."

      {
          question: "What's the difference between hiring game developers in the USA vs. the UK vs. Europe?",
          answer: "Hiring in the USA or UK gives you access to industry-leading creative talent and studios known for innovative, high-budget titles, with excellent timezone alignment for US/UK companies. Outsourcing to a game development team in Eastern Europe often provides a significant cost advantage with exceptional technical proficiency and a strong work ethic, making it a hotspot for high-quality production on a reasonable budget."
      },
      {
          question: "Is Unity game development outsourcing a good choice for my project?",
          answer: "Unity is an incredibly versatile and powerful engine, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of projects. Its 'write once, deploy anywhere' capability is perfect for targeting multiple platforms like mobile (iOS/Android), PC, and consoles. Outsourcing to a specialized Unity team gives you access to deep expertise to maximize performance and create stunning visuals."
      },
      {
          question: "What should I look for in an AR/VR/XR & META game development outsourcing partner?",
          answer: "This is a highly specialized field. Look for a company with a specific portfolio of shipped AR/VR titles. They must understand spatial computing, performance optimization for headsets (like Meta Quest), and intuitive UX for immersive environments. Ask about their experience with platform-specific requirements for the App Lab or SteamVR. Don't settle for a generalist; you need a specialist."
