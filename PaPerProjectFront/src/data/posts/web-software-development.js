        question: "What is the difference between web development and software development?",
        answer: "Web development specifically refers to creating websites and web applications that run in a browser. Software development is a broader term that includes web development, but also mobile apps, desktop applications, operating systems, and more. Many principles overlap, but the scope is different."
      },
      {
        question: "How much does custom web app development cost?",
        answer: "The cost varies widely based on complexity, features, and the technology stack. A simple MVP might cost a few thousand dollars, while a complex enterprise platform could be hundreds of thousands. A managed outsourcing service can provide a fixed-price quote based on your specific requirements."
      },
      {
        question: "Why should I choose a managed service for freelance software projects?",
        answer: "For any non-trivial software project, a managed service is crucial. It provides a project manager who oversees the entire process, ensures code quality, manages testing, and keeps the project on track. This de-risks the project and is far more effective than trying to manage individual freelance developers yourself."
