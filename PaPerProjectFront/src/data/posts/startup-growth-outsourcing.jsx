      question: 'When is the right time for a startup to start outsourcing?',
      answer: 'The ideal time is at the MVP stage. Outsourcing allows you to validate your idea and build a functional product without the high cost and long process of hiring a full-time team. It lets you stay lean and agile.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is outsourcing expensive for a bootstrapped startup?',
      answer: 'It\'s often more cost-effective than hiring. With a pay-per-project model, you get a fixed price, avoiding the recurring costs of salaries, benefits, and software licenses. It provides budget certainty, which is crucial for early-stage companies.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I protect my startup idea when outsourcing?',
      answer: 'Work with a managed platform that provides ironclad NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements) and clear IP (Intellectual Property) ownership clauses in their contracts. This ensures your idea is legally protected and you own 100% of the code.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I still get VC funding if my team is outsourced?',
      answer: 'Yes, and it can even be an advantage. Showing investors you have a working product and early traction—achieved efficiently through outsourcing—is much more powerful than just having an idea. It demonstrates your ability to execute and manage resources effectively.'
