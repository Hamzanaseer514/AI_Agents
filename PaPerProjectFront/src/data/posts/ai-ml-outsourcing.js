        question: "What's the difference between AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science?",
        answer: "Think of AI as the broad goal of creating intelligent machines. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that uses algorithms to learn from data. Data Science is a broader field that involves extracting insights from data, which often uses ML techniques. When you're outsourcing, you need a team that understands all three."
      },
      {
        question: "How much does it cost to outsource an AI project?",
        answer: "The cost varies greatly depending on the complexity, from simple predictive models to advanced natural language processing. An 'AI MVP development' project is a great starting point to test an idea with a defined budget. It's far more cost-effective than hiring a full-time in-house team."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I outsource if I don't have a lot of data?",
        answer: "Yes. While more data is often better, a good data science team can start with smaller datasets. Part of their job is 'data augmentation' and advising on a data acquisition strategy. The key is to start with a clear problem you want to solve."
