        question: "What's the best e-commerce platform for a new business in 2025?",
        answer: "For most new businesses, Shopify is the best choice due to its ease of use, robust app ecosystem, and scalability. It allows you to get to market quickly. A skilled 'Shopify freelance expert' can customize it to look unique and perform optimally. For larger enterprises with complex needs, Magento or a custom 'headless commerce' solution might be more appropriate."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I find a reliable 'ecommerce developer UK' or globally?",
        answer: "Look for developers with a strong, verifiable portfolio of live e-commerce stores. Check their expertise in your chosen platform (Shopify, Magento, etc.) and ask for case studies with measurable results (e.g., conversion rate increase). Using a managed platform that pre-vets developers is the safest way to ensure you hire a true professional."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it cheaper to 'build an ecommerce site freelance' or use a platform?",
        answer: "Using a platform like Shopify is almost always cheaper and faster for the initial build. A completely custom freelance build is a much larger investment, reserved for businesses with unique functional requirements that platforms can't meet. The real cost is in lost sales from a poorly built site, so investing in an expert is key."
      },
      {
        question: "Why is 'Magento development outsourcing' so popular for larger stores?",
        answer: "Magento (now Adobe Commerce) is incredibly powerful but also very complex. A successful Magento store requires deep expertise in its architecture, security, and performance optimization. Outsourcing to a specialized agency or team provides this expertise without the massive cost and difficulty of building a large in-house team."
      },
      {
        question: "What is 'headless commerce' and is it right for my business?",
        answer: "Headless commerce separates your frontend (the customer-facing storefront) from your backend (the e-commerce engine). This allows for greater design freedom, faster performance, and easier integration with other channels (like mobile apps). It's an advanced strategy, best for established brands looking to create unique, high-performance customer experiences."
      },
      {
        question: "What key skills should a top 'Shopify freelance expert' have?",
        answer: "A top expert should have deep knowledge of Shopify's Liquid templating language, experience with theme customization, skills in integrating and configuring key apps, and a strong understanding of site speed optimization and conversion rate optimization (CRO) principles."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the most critical features for a new e-commerce site?",
        answer: "The must-haves are: high-quality product photography, crystal-clear product descriptions, a simple and secure checkout process, full mobile responsiveness, customer reviews and social proof, and transparent shipping and return policies. These build trust and are essential for conversions."
      },
      {
        question: "How can I improve my store's conversion rate?",
        answer: "Focus on the user experience. Key drivers are: lightning-fast page load speed, a simplified checkout process (fewer clicks!), prominent customer reviews, offering multiple payment options (including digital wallets like Apple Pay), and clear, high-quality product images and videos."
