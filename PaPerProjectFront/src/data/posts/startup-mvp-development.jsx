        question: "What is an MVP and why is it absolutely critical for startups?",
        answer: "An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is the most basic version of your product that solves a core problem for a specific user. It's critical for 'startup MVP development' because it allows you to test your core business idea, gather real-world user feedback, and secure investor funding with minimal upfront investment."
      },
      {
        question: "How fast can an MVP be built, and how can I 'build MVP fast'?",
        answer: "A well-scoped MVP can often be developed and launched within 6 to 12 weeks. The key to speed is ruthless prioritization of features and partnering with an experienced, managed development team that can start immediately and execute efficiently."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I 'hire an MVP developer' or outsource the entire product development?",
        answer: "For most non-technical founders, 'outsourcing the startup product' to a managed team is far more effective. A team provides not just a developer, but also a project manager and designer, ensuring a cohesive and professional 'startup tech execution' without you having to manage the process."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the primary goal of a 'minimum viable product freelance' project?",
        answer: "The primary goal is not to build a perfect, feature-complete product. The goal is to learn as quickly as possible. You build just enough to test your core hypothesis with real users and gather data to guide your next steps. It's all about speed and validated learning."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I define the 'minimum' set of features for my MVP?",
        answer: "Focus on the one core user journey that solves the most painful problem for your target customer. Make a list of all potential features, then ruthlessly cut everything that isn't absolutely essential for that single journey. A good product strategist can help you with this critical process."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the biggest mistakes to avoid when building an MVP?",
        answer: "The top mistakes are: 1) 'Gold-plating' or adding too many features (turning it into a 'Maximum' Viable Product). 2) Not talking to potential users before and during development. 3) Focusing on perfection instead of speed. 4) Having no clear metrics to define what success or failure looks like."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I secure venture capital funding with just an MVP?",
        answer: "Yes, and it's often preferred. Many investors will not fund just an idea. A working MVP with even a small amount of user traction dramatically de-risks their investment, as it proves you have a validated concept and the ability to execute."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between an MVP and a prototype?",
        answer: "A prototype is typically a non-functional mockup or wireframe used to test a design concept or user flow. An MVP is a functional, working product, albeit with a limited feature set. Real users can log in and use an MVP to solve a real problem."
