      question: "What is the best alternative to Upwork and Fiverr?",
      answer: "The best alternative is a platform that offers zero commission, vetted talent, and managed project services. Unlike marketplaces, these platforms act as project partners, providing project managers, quality guarantees, and IP protection without taking a cut from your budget."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any freelance sites with no fees?",
      answer: "Yes! Platforms like ours operate on a zero-commission model. You pay a fixed price for your project, and that entire budget goes towards the talent and management. There are no hidden fees, processing charges, or commission cuts."
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from hiring a freelancer directly?",
      answer: "While hiring directly also avoids platform fees, you're responsible for the entire vetting, hiring, and management process. A managed service provides a safety net: we vet the talent, manage the project, guarantee quality, and protect your IP with NDAs, giving you peace of mind and freeing up your time."
