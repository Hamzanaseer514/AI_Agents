          question: "How is a managed outsourcing platform a better alternative to Upwork or Freelancer.com?",
          answer: "A managed platform eliminates the biggest problems of open marketplaces: risk and time-wasting. Instead of you sifting through hundreds of low-quality bids, we provide a pre-vetted, elite developer or team perfectly matched to your project. We add a layer of project management, quality guarantees, and IP protection, making us a true project partner, not just a middleman."
      },
      {
          question: "What are the key differences in the Fiverr vs. PayPerProject model?",
          answer: "Fiverr is a 'gig economy' marketplace, excellent for small, discrete, and transactional tasks. PayPerProject is built for complex, end-to-end projects. With us, you're not buying a small gig; you're commissioning a fully managed project with a dedicated team, clear milestones, and a guarantee of success, all based on a transparent 'pay per project' freelance model."
      },
      {
          question: "Can I really hire vetted developers with no commission?",
          answer: "Yes, absolutely. Our business model is fundamentally different. We charge a fixed project price that covers the elite talent and the comprehensive project management. There are no hidden percentage-based commissions or processing fees that platforms like Upwork and Fiverr charge. The price you're quoted is the price you pay."
      },
      {
          question: "Why is your platform considered a top Upwork competitor in the UK?",
          answer: "UK businesses value quality, reliability, and clear communication. Our model is built on these principles. By providing vetted, UK-based or nearshore talent, dedicated project management, and a secure, pay-per-project framework, we solve the main pain points that UK clients experience on large, open marketplaces, making us the preferred choice for serious projects."
