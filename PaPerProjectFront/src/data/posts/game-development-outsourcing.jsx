          question: "Why should I 'hire a game developer company per project' instead of individual freelancers?",
          answer: "For any game beyond a simple prototype, a company is far superior. A company provides a cohesive, managed team of specialists—artists, designers, programmers, QA testers, and a project manager. This eliminates the huge management burden on you and ensures a polished, integrated final product."
      },
      {
          question: "What are the pros and cons of hiring game developers in the USA vs. Europe?",
          answer: "Hiring 'game developers in the USA' or UK provides access to top creative studios and perfect time-zone alignment for local companies, but at the highest cost. Outsourcing to a team in Eastern Europe offers a significant cost advantage for exceptional technical talent, making it a hotspot for high-quality production on a reasonable budget."
      },
      {
          question: "Is 'Unity game development outsourcing' the best choice for my game?",
          answer: "Unity is an incredibly versatile engine, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of projects, especially mobile games (iOS/Android), PC titles, and AR/VR experiences. Its cross-platform capabilities are a major advantage. Outsourcing to a specialized Unity team gives you access to deep expertise to maximize performance."
      },
      {
          question: "What must I look for in an 'AR/VR/XR & META game development outsourcing' partner?",
          answer: "This is a highly specialized field. You MUST look for a company with a portfolio of shipped AR/VR titles. They need to have deep expertise in performance optimization for headsets (like Meta Quest), intuitive UX design for immersive 3D space, and knowledge of platform-specific requirements for stores like the App Lab or SteamVR. Do not hire a generalist."
      },
      {
        question: "How much does 'game development outsourcing' cost?",
        answer: "Costs vary dramatically based on scope and complexity. A simple 2D mobile game could be $20,000 - $70,000. A more complex 3D indie game for PC/console could range from $100,000 to $500,000+. A pay-per-project model is essential for defining the scope and locking in a predictable budget."
      },
      {
        question: "What is a Game Design Document (GDD) and is it really necessary?",
        answer: "A GDD is the master blueprint for your game. It details the core mechanics, art style, story, level design, UI, and more. It is absolutely essential. A professional outsourcing partner will help you create or refine a detailed GDD before any major development work begins to ensure complete alignment."
      },
      {
        question: "How is my game's Intellectual Property (IP) protected when I outsource?",
        answer: "Your IP is protected through a robust Master Service Agreement (MSA). This legal contract must explicitly state that you, the client, own 100% of the intellectual property, including all source code, art assets, characters, and the game itself. This is non-negotiable."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between outsourcing to a Unity vs. Unreal Engine team?",
        answer: "Unity is often praised for its flexibility, especially for mobile, 2D, and stylized 3D games, and it has a larger talent pool. Unreal Engine is a powerhouse for high-fidelity, photorealistic 3D graphics and is the standard for many AAA titles. The choice depends entirely on your game's artistic vision and technical requirements."
