          question: "What's the most efficient way to 'build an MVP with a freelance team'?",
          answer: "The most efficient way is to use a managed service that provides a pre-vetted, cohesive team. This avoids the chaos of managing individual freelancers. A 'founder-friendly dev studio' will provide a project manager who translates your vision into a lean roadmap, focusing only on core features to get to market quickly and start gathering user feedback."
      },
      {
          question: "How does 'MVP development cost' differ across the UK, US, Qatar, and Europe?",
          answer: "Costs vary significantly. The US and UK are the most expensive but offer proximity to major investment hubs. Western Europe is slightly less, while Eastern Europe offers a 'sweet spot' of high-quality talent at a much lower cost. Qatar is an emerging, government-supported hub ideal for targeting the MENA market. A good partner will offer transparent, fixed-price quotes to manage your budget effectively."
      },
      {
          question: "I'm a non-technical founder. Should I 'hire a startup CTO per project'?",
          answer: "Absolutely. A fractional or per-project CTO is a game-changer for non-technical founders. They provide high-level technical strategy, make crucial architectural decisions, and oversee the development team without the cost of a full-time executive salary. This ensures your 'early-stage product development' is built on a solid foundation."
      },
      {
          question: "Why should 'startups outsource their product team' instead of hiring?",
          answer: "Outsourcing provides speed and expertise that's hard to match with early-stage hiring. You get immediate access to a full, experienced team (devs, designers, PMs) that's already used to working together. This drastically cuts down your time-to-market, conserves capital, and allows you to focus on business development and fundraising."
