      const faqs = [
        { q: "What is Agentic AI and how is it different from regular automation?", a: "Agentic AI goes beyond simple automation. Instead of following pre-programmed rules, our AI 'agents' are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They can reason, learn, and adapt, solving problems they've never seen before." },
        { q: "Is this just another name for chatbots?", a: "No. While a chatbot is a simple form of AI, Agentic AI is far more advanced. A chatbot can answer questions. An AI Agent can understand a goal like 'reduce customer churn by 5%', then devise and execute a multi-step strategy across different systems to achieve it." },
        { q: "How do you ensure the AI agents are secure and don't make mistakes?", a: "Security is paramount. Our agents operate in a secure, sandboxed environment with strict permissions. We implement 'human-in-the-loop' protocols for critical decisions, where an agent must get human approval before taking a high-stakes action. They are trained with extensive guardrails to prevent undesirable outcomes." },
        { q: "What kind of ROI can we expect?", a: "Clients typically see significant ROI through three main areas: 1) Drastic reduction in manual labor costs (up to 70%), 2) Increased revenue through optimization and speed (e.g., faster sales cycles, better pricing), and 3) Risk mitigation by reducing human error in critical processes." },
        { q: "How long does it take to implement an AI agent?", a: "Implementation is faster than you might think. We start with a 'pilot' agent to solve a specific, high-impact problem, which can often be deployed in 4-6 weeks. From there, we can scale the solution across your organization." },
        { q: "Do we need a team of data scientists to use this?", a: "No. We provide a fully managed service. Our team of AI experts handles the entire process, from identifying use cases and training the agents to deployment and ongoing optimization. You get the benefits of AI without the overhead." },
        { q: "Can your AI agents integrate with our existing software?", a: "Yes. Our agents are designed to be 'API-first'. They can connect to and operate virtually any modern software with an API, from your CRM and ERP to custom internal tools. They act as a universal connector for your entire tech stack." },
        { q: "How is data privacy handled?", a: "We adhere to the strictest data privacy standards like GDPR and CCPA. Your data is never used to train models for other clients. For sensitive applications, we can deploy the entire AI system within your own private cloud or on-premise infrastructure." },
        { q: "What happens if the AI can't solve a problem?", a: "Our agents are designed with robust 'escalation paths'. When an agent encounters a novel problem it cannot solve, it automatically gathers all relevant context and escalates the issue to a designated human expert for a decision. It then learns from that interaction for the future." },
        { q: "How do you measure the success of an AI agent?", a: "Success is measured against clear, pre-defined KPIs that we establish with you at the start of the project. This could be 'reduce average ticket resolution time by 50%', 'increase sales qualified leads by 30%', or 'achieve 99.9% accuracy in compliance checks'." },
        { q: "What's the difference between your solution and using off-the-shelf AI tools?", a: "Off-the-shelf tools provide generic capabilities. We build custom, purpose-built AI agents that are tailored to your specific business logic, processes, and goals. This results in a much deeper level of integration and a significantly higher impact on your core operations." },
        { q: "How do we get started?", a: "It starts with a simple, no-obligation discovery call. We'll discuss your business challenges and identify the most impactful use case for a pilot AI agent. From there, we'll provide a clear proposal and roadmap for deployment." },
